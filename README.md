DeepVision: Classifying CIFAR-10 Images with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project focuses on the classification of small images from the renowned CIFAR-10 dataset using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification system capable of accurately identifying objects in small images.
The CIFAR-10 dataset, sourced from TensorFlow's Keras datasets, poses a unique challenge with ten distinct classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

Why CIFAR-10?
CIFAR-10 serves as the perfect playground for testing the capabilities of our deep learning model. 
The diverse set of images and classes allows us to showcase the power of Convolutional Neural Networks in distinguishing between a wide range of objects.

Approach: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
To tackle the complexities of image classification, we leverage the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks. 
CNNs are designed to mimic the human visual system, enabling them to automatically learn and hierarchically represent features from images.
By employing multiple convolutional and pooling layers, our model becomes adept at recognizing intricate patterns and spatial hierarchies within the images.
